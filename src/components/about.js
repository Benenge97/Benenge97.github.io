      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Beholi Enenge, a student at Lehman College majoring
        in Computer Graphics and Imaging (CGI). I prefer traditional art
        over digital art since i'm still a novice. When it comes to coding
        my knowledge is very little. I don't have a passion for art, but i'm
        mainly self taught and draw from observation.
